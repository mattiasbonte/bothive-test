# Bothive Practical Test

Make a web application that interacts with the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/). When a user goes to your website, they should see an overview of all the planets. When they click on a planet they should get more information about that planet. If there are any notable people from the planet your application should also display some basic information about them on the "Planet Details" page. For the coding challenge you\re free to use any programming language or framework you'd like.
